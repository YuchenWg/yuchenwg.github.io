title: Yuchen Wang's Introduction
---

Following my passion for Data Science and programming, I am currently a data scientist managing a small team at Lux Aerobot, a remote sensing and analytics company. Through various projects with the Canadian Armed Forces (CAF) and Canadian Space Agency (CSA), I've gained significant insight in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Reinforcement Learning and Deep Learning. Combined with computer science training from my Bachelor of Science at the University of Melbourne, I'm developing advanced computer vision models that will allow me to add value to the collected remote sensing data.

Technical skills: Python, R, PyTorch, SQL, SAS, JAVA, C/C++, HTML
